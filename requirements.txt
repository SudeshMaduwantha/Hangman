requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file is used to specify the dependencies and libraries needed to run your Python application. When deploying a Flask application, this file ensures that the correct versions of all required packages are installed.

Contents:

Flask: The main web framework for building web applications in Python. It provides the tools and libraries needed to create routes, handle requests, and serve content.
Example Content:

makefile
Copy code
flask==2.0.2
How It Works:

Each line in requirements.txt specifies a package and its version. For example, flask==2.0.2 means that version 2.0.2 of Flask is required.
When deploying to platforms like Heroku or setting up a virtual environment, running pip install -r requirements.txt installs all the specified packages.
Purpose:

Consistency: Ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same versions of libraries, reducing compatibility issues.
Deployment: Simplifies the process of installing dependencies on deployment platforms or new environments.
Usage:

Create requirements.txt by running:
bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
This command captures all currently installed packages and their versions into the file.
